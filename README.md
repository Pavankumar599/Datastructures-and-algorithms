# Datastructures-and-algorithms
This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice code. It includes solutions to problems from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and others. Iâ€™m using this to improve my coding skills, prepare for interviews, and document my learning journey.
